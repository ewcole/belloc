Hillaire Belloc's Works
=======================

This is a small project for proofreading a text of Hillaire
Belloc's /Servile State/ which I recovered from the Internet Archive at
[http://archive.org/details/servilestate00belluoft].

The files for this project are in org-mode format, which is used by a very powerful major mode of the very powerful emacs text editor.  You can learn more at [http://orgmode.org/].
